# You are given a 0-indexed array of strings words and a character x.
# Return an array of indices representing the words that contain the character x
# Note that the returned array may be in any order.

# Example 1:
# Input: words = ["leet","code"], x = "e"
# Output: [0,1]
# Explanation: "e" occurs in both words: "leet", and "code". Hence, we return
# indices 0 and 1.
